# iOS WebSocket Spike

The purpose of this spike is to investigate the use of WebSockets on iOS.

## Intro

The app will be a simple IM client using WebSockets as its communication protocol. I intend to use SocketRocket or an alternative library.

The server is based on https://github.com/robrighter/node-boilerplate which uses nodejs and socket.io.
